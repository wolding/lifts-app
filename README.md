# lifts-app
A way to improve/ organise the lifts we give at work between venues

Initial idea: create an empty list, new lifts get (inserted to the front of the list?) or (appended to the end of the list?). When the lift is complete, driver deletes (first/ last) item on list.

Expansions: Delete specific items on list, Show name, origin, destination, time of booking, time lift ordered. (2d array? Dictionary?)
