# lifts-app
A way to improve/ organise the lifts we give at work between venues. A chauffeur app?

Initial idea: create an empty list, new jobs get appended to a list. When the lift is complete, driver deletes job from list.


Expansions: Delete specific items on list, Show name, origin, destination, time of booking, time lift ordered. (2d array? Dictionary?)
